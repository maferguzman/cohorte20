			A string is a sequence of characters that behave like an object in Java. The string is one of the most common and used data structures after arrays. It is an object that stores the data in a character array.

			For better clarity, just consider a string as a character array wherein you can solve many string-based problems.

			To create a string object, you need the java.lang.String class. Java programming uses UTF -16 to represent a string. Strings are immutable so that their internal state remains constant after the object is entirely created. The string object performs various operations, but reverse strings in Java are the most widely used function.

			How to Reverse a String in Java?
			Since the strings are immutable objects, you need to create another string to reverse them. The string class doesn't have a reverse method to reverse the string. It has a toCharArray() method to do the reverse.

			By Using toCharArray()
			The code below will help you understand how to reverse a string. By using toCharArray() method is one approach to reverse a string in Java.

			The code also uses the length, which gives the total length of the string variable.

			The for loop iterates till the end of the string index zero.

			Code 
			//ReverseString using CharcterArray.

			public static void main(String[] arg) {

			// declaring variable

			String stringinput = "Independent";

			        // convert String to character array

			        // by using toCharArray

			        char[] resultarray = stringinput.toCharArray();

			        //iteration

			        for (int i = resultarray.length - 1; i >= 0; i--)

			         // print reversed String

			            System.out.print(resultarray[i]);

			}  
	
}
